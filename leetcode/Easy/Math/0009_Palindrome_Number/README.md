- **LeetCode Link**: [https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/)
- **Problem ID**: 9
- **Language**: Java

## Solution Design

### Method Explanation
- *We solve this problem by leveraging standard data structures or algorithms suitable for the problem constraints.*
- *Make sure to update this section with notes on your implementation approaches.*

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N)\) (where \(N\) is the number of elements)
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) auxiliary space

## Solution Code

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        if (x < 0) {
            return false;
        }

        int reverse = 0;
        int xcopy = x;

        while (x > 0) {
            reverse = (reverse * 10) + (x % 10);
            x /= 10;
        }

        return reverse == xcopy;        
    }
}
```
